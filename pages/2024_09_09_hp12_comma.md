The HP-12c is probably the most iconic financial calculator.  Not being in finance myself, and in fact being terribly bad at that kind of thing, I never quite got the purpose of these special-purpose devices.  My ignorance came to a halt due to an unfortunate combination of my fixed-rate mortgage period ending and Liz Truss happening, and I was driven to a sudden keen interest in the 'time value of money' (TVM) calculation.

My story begins when I programmed my scientific calculator to solve the TVM unknowns.  As a demonstration of pocket calculator programming, the manual of the venerable HP-42s scientific gives two ways you can write your own TVM solver.  While great as a programming tutorial, it was less good at TVM solving from both an accuracy and a user-interface angle.  I set about improving this program, and as a result learned far more about TVM solving than I could ever have imagined.  A slight change in the algorithm easily introduce significant regressions and I quickly realised the need for a good set of tests.

## Testing TVMs

Reading all I could on TVM solving, collecting example problems from here and there, and making some of my own, I constructed a battery of 13 TVM problems which tested edge-case scenarios designed to instill fear in any garden-variety TVM solver.  With the help of many from the HP museum and Swiss micros forums, I set about testing as many financial calculators as I could find, learning a lot about their design in the process.

But that is another story.

What you need to know is that the HP-12c is the most iconic of all financial calculators.  It is probably the longest-running continuously-produced calculator, starting life in 1981.  Not their first financial device, Hewlett-Packard (HP) had refined their TVM solver to the point that the HP-12c was well placed to develop an enviable reputation as the 'de-facto' financial calculator.  The calculator was written into high-value contracts[^1], with the expectation that these machines would return the exact same answer into eternity.

In order to maintain this reputation, HP have taken meticulous care in porting their code across several electronic platforms necessary to span 40+ years of production.  Surely, they would not mess with the grail of finance machines?

## An Intriguing Reddit Post 

Earlier this year I came across a fairly benign-looking reddit post describing some difficulty changing the decimal point to a decimal comma on a new Brazilian-bought HP-12c.  Most of the replies were along the lines of 'you're holding it wrong', but something caught my attention.  Someone chimed in that they had the same experience, and pointed to numerous Amazon reviews describing similar woes.

To find out for myself, I VPN'd myself over to the Brazilian Amazon and started reading (with the assistance of my phone and google translate) the reviews, and what I saw was quite consistent - people couldn't change the point to the comma, and the calculator also failed on a type of calculation to return the internal rate of return (IRR).

I was curious, was this a different version of the HP-12c?  Was it a fake?  It is generally accepted that the HP-12c (and to some degree the related HP-12c platinum) will return exactly the same results no matter, why would it otherwise?  I asked if someone would run the TVM tests I had collected, and a kind redditor obliged, recording results almost entirely different to the regular HP-12c, or any other calculator for that matter.

This was hard to explain.  The results were not unreasonable, but undid many decades of advancement in the technical progress of this 'non-trivial' problem.  The natural inclination was to suspect a fake device, something which is rife in the world of modern Casio calculators.  However, fake HP-12c's are not that prolific in the wild, and further examination of the reviews suggested that despite official replacements from HP, the calculators continued to malfunction.

Lets have a look at a few of these TVM puzzles to get a better idea of what is different.

## A Penny for Your Thoughts

If you saved one penny every second for a year, in an account with an interest rate of 10%, how much would you have by the end of the year?

This is a 'solve-for-future-value' problem, and it has a couple of technical challenges.

$$ 0 = PV + PMT.\left[ \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-N}}{i} \right].(1 + ip) + FV(1 + i)^{-N} $$

Above is the TVM equation itself in all its glory.  You'll notice the motif of adding one to the interest rate, and then raising it to number of payments.  This becomes a problem when periodic interest rate is very small and the number of payments very high, as we have in the above problem

The addition of 1 to a very small number is not easily represented by a floating point representation, rapidly losing information.  There are ways around this but these can be absent on the earliest and inferior financial calculators.  The worlds first financial calculator, the HP-80, was erroneous enough that deposited money receiving a very small interest rate, would *lose* value.

We tested our rogue HP-12c, and it returned a result of 331666.9849, from a true result of 331667.00669... giving it an accuracy[^2] of 7.2, somewhere between the HP-70 of 1974 and the HP-22 of 1975, but far off the 10.6 achieved by the regular HP-12c and 12.2 of the HP-12c Precision.

## When There is Little Interest

You wish to borrow $100'000, and repay over 480 payments at an interest rate of 0%.  What are the monthly payments?  If you then input the calculated monthly payments, present value and number of payments, can your solver find the interest rate of zero again?

For unoptimised algorithms, this can cause some real problems.  Our rogue HP-12c fails on the very first part of this problem returning an error.  The answer is surprisingly easy and doesn't need a financial calculator - simply take 100'000 and divide it by 480.  You get -208.33 recurring.

$$ PMT = \frac{-PV - FV(1+i)^{-N}}{(1 + ip)\frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-N}}{i}} $$

It is possible to re-arrange the TVM formula to algebraically calculate each unknown, except for one.  Above is how we can solve for PMT.  The equation looks complicated, and it is poorly arranged, but I have picked this for the divide by 'i' in the bottom right.  Now you can guess how the rogue HP-12c ran into trouble - it likely attempted to divide by zero, a rookie mistake in the world of TVM solving.

Solving for 'i' is the special case.  This requires an iterative approach, essentially guessing and refining until you home in on the answer.  There is a lot written on the pros and cons of various methods of doing this, as well as different equations.  When we attempt to back-calculate the interest rate in this puzzle, unfortunately the rogue HP-12 fails again, this time probably due to instability of the solver as 'i' approaches zero.

## When There is Too Much Interest

Our poor HP-12c has collected a few black marks now, but there is hope.

What interest rate would balance an investment of $50 upfront, returning you $30 each year for 10 years, with $400 to be paid at the end?  This would be a very unusual arrangement, and fittingly, there is an unusual answer in that there are two possible interest rates which would satisfy this.  One is 14.4% and the other 53.2%.  No HP financial calculator (or many others) will attempt to return a result on this, but interestingly in a rare win, the rogue HP-12c gives us 14.44 and an accuracy of 8.7.  Not bad.

## So What is Going On?

![Close up of the HP-12c](./media/DSC_3105a.JPG)

The only conclusion is that someone, somewhere had a stab at completely re-writing the TVM solver.  The firmware is dated as 2023-03-19, which is later than the last known (and fully regular) firmware of 2015-01-08.  The strange thing is that the HP-12c ROM is fairly easy to obtain, whether you are HP or not, so why re-write it?  Did anyone in HP authorise a TVM solver returning different results, and did testing just not catch the edge cases (and not-so-edge cases) when it was different?

It looks like HP are already working hard to reverse this blot in the otherwise esteemed history of the HP-12c.  A more recently ordered device from an Amazon store, bought just a few weeks before writing this, returned correct results and was using the 2015 firmware.  Time will tell whether this rogue HP-12c will do any damage to its reputation, either in Brazil or in other parts of the world, and this will partly depend on how many are out in the wild, and whether HP are able to satisfactorily replace the units.

These days pocket calculators are not generally used to give you a quote on your mortgage renewal.  Instead, banks likely run their own calculations on bespoke software or maybe a spreadsheet, though I'd be curious to know how optimised these are.  Most computer software represents numbers using a 64-bit binary representation (for which a penny is not precisely representable), and it would be interesting to see how this compares to the algorithms working on these decimal-coded calculator representations.

As it stands, the story of the rogue HP-12c may never be fully explained.  For me it sums up a curiosity I have had in a mathematical formula, re-visiting some school maths and learning several things new.  I developed a huge respect for the engineering challenge faced over the years to improve the accuracy of TVM solving, as well as the ingenuity of such an optimised solving user-interface.  The forensic tests tell us more about how these devices work beneath the surface, and while this particular HP-12c calculator is the subject of these thoughts, they all have their own story to tell.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you so much to my Brazilian friend who tirelessly worked with me to test the rogue HP-12c and who eventually, in a cross-continental trust exercise, allowed me to order them another calculator, while relinquishing their own so I could get my hands on the real thing.  Many thanks to everyone on the HP museums forum and the Swissmicros forum who have contributed to hundreds of threads on the HP-12c, as well as TVM solving in general.  As a collective they have tested a huge number of devices with my collection of TVM puzzles, and were involved with working out whether this rogue variant existed or not.  I also thank Swissmicros, Thomas Okken and Albert Chan who are the real geniuses behind the best calculator known to man[^3] and the most cutting-edge TVM solver you can get your hands on[^4].
